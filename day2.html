    <h1>Day 2</h1>
    <h2>this is subheading in smaller font then headings!!</h2>
    <p>Did you know that people spent so much time thinking about others while so less about oneself.(In nepali we phrase it "afno agan ko bhaisi nadekni arkako agan ko jumra")if they do then its mostly because of selffishness about what they can have more instead of how far they have come with struggles and how proud they actually are.In most of the japanese novels and story you can find that most of them include these kind of intresting informative facts that make us look at ourselves with doubt if we're also follpwing so?and yes indeed!!haha no wonder why japan can be known as so advanced in technology and real world circumtances.</p>
    <p>just typing randomly dont mind !!even if you do i wont mind  ðŸ˜†</p>
